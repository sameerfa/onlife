### Onlife

An experiment to create a decentralized CLI based forum. 

To run download [this](https://github.com/textileio/desktop/releases/tag/v0.3.0) and run

```
yarn install
yarn chat
```



#### "There is something now". Used [Textile.io](https://www.textile.io) for this experiment. Might need a different approach altogether. If you have any resources or ideas on how we can achieve this, hit me up.
